How to make fruit salad with whipped cream
It might seem ridiculous that there is such a thing as a recipe for a fruit salad. After all, it is mainly just about chopping some fruit up and mixing them together. But still, you can add some more ingredients to make it extra yummy.
chop up the larger fruit - strawberries, bananas, kiwis, the smaller ones: grapes and blueberries can go in whole - if the grapes are rather large, you can also half or quarter them
you can either add the pimm's as it is, or make it sweeter by adding a teaspoon of sugar to it to make it into a syrup
squirt the cream on top and top with a cherry - if you don't have squirty cream, whip up the cream until it holds stiff peaks
serve immediately
